# Language by example

I often find myself searching for examples in `man` pages, `tldr` or whenever I type `--help`.
Unfortunately, many times there are either no examples or they lack context such as imports etc.

Thus, here I try to provide myself with a random bunch of examples seperated by lanuage.
