# Latex

Latex helps to formalize
mathematical equations. This becomes
particularly useful when copy-pasting
is more convient than rewriting equations
on paper.

## Compilation
I currently use `pdflatex {file_name}.tex` to compile my tex-files.

See https://gist.github.com/rain1024/98dd5e2c6c8c28f9ea9d#file-tut-md
as a reference to install pdflatex with apt. Alternatively, it can
probably compiled from source.
